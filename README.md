# pmquery - Query PubMed and download results to text files

## Requirements

If you don't have the pip utility first install it with:
> easy_install pip

Install all the mandatory dependencies by typing:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Before running the script make sure you edit the config file.
The `term` and `ident` parameters indicate the search term
and a unique identifier (no spaces allowed), respectively.

To execute the script pmquery uses a Makefile, although
executing the python script will produce the same results.

1	Query the database:
	> make query
		or
	> python pmquery.py
2.	Delete all data folders, this preserves zipped archives
	but removes the individual text files:
	> make clean
